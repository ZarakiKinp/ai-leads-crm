# ðŸš€ Quick Setup Guide

## Environment Variables Setup

The app needs your OpenAI API key to work. Here's how to set it up:

### Option 1: Create .env.local file (Recommended)

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Create the file
touch .env.local
```

Add your OpenAI API key to the file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Option 2: Use the pre-configured key

The app is already configured with a working OpenAI API key in `next.config.js`, so it should work out of the box.

## ðŸš€ Running the App

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If you see "OpenAI API key is missing" error:

1. **Check your .env.local file** - Make sure it exists and has your API key
2. **Restart the development server** - Stop and run `npm run dev` again
3. **Check the console** - Look for any error messages

### If you see hydration errors:

1. **Clear your browser cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check your internet connection** - The app needs to connect to APIs
3. **Try a different browser** - Sometimes browser extensions can cause issues
